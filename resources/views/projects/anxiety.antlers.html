        <h2>What is Anxiety?</h2>
        <p>Anxiety is when you feel really worried or scared about things, sometimes even things that haven't happened yet. It can make your heart beat fast, your stomach feel weird, or make it hard to sleep.</p>

        <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
        <p>I know what it's like to feel anxious. Sometimes it's hard to explain to people who don't understand. I want to help others feel less alone and show them that it's okay to feel this way.</p>

        <h2>Tips That Help Me</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Take deep breaths - breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 4, breathe out for 4</li>
            <li>Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling</li>
            <li>Do something you enjoy to take your mind off worries</li>
            <li>Remember that the anxious feeling will pass</li>
        </ul>
